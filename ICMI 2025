27th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction
(13-17 Oct 2025)  

We are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. 
ICMI 2025 will feature keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), 
demonstrations, exhibits, doctoral spotlight papers, and late-breaking papers. 
The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. 

The proceedings of all ICMI 2025 papers, including Long and Short Papers, will be published by ACM as part of their 
series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library, and the adjunct proceedings will feature the workshop papers.
